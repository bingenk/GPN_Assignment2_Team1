## Protagonist: :elf_man:

A young and adventurous hero named "Flix", is chosen by the ancient spirits to restore balance. Flix must journey through each realm, overcoming increasingly challenging platform levels, to retrieve the pieces of the Orb and restore harmony.

## Storyline: :closed_book:

Our game is set in a world where each realm is governed by a unique element (fire, water, earth, air, etc.). The harmony of these realms is maintained by a mystical artifact known as the "Elemental Orb". However, an evil sorcerer has the Orb, causing chaos and imbalance among the realms. Each piece of the Orb has landed in a different realm, altering its nature and making it hostile.

## Gameplay Elements: :joystick: :video_game:

Each realm could have unique gameplay mechanics related to its element. For example, the earth realm could have destructible terrain, the water realm could have underwater physics, and the air realm could have wind currents affecting movement. This would keep the gameplay fresh and engaging, as players would need to adapt to the changing mechanics.

As the game progresses, the levels would become more challenging, reflecting Flix's growing skills and maturity. The final level could be a confrontation with the sorcerer, where Flix must use all the skills he's learned to defeat him and restore the Orb.


## Game Mechanics Used or Could be Used: :crossed_swords: :triangular_ruler:

<em>**Elemental Abilities:**</em> As Flix progresses through each realm, he could gain abilities related to that realm's element. For example, in the fire realm, he could a fire dash that allows him to move quickly and damage enemies. In the water realm, he could gain the ability to breathe underwater and swim against strong currents.

<em>**Platforming Challenges:**</em> Traditional platforming mechanics like jumping, double jumping, wall jumping, and sliding could be used. The difficulty and complexity of these challenges would increase as the game progresses.

<em>**Puzzle Solving:**</em> Some levels could incorporate puzzles that need to be solved using Flix's elemental abilities. For example, in the earth realm, Flix might need to use his earth ability to move rocks and create a path forward.

<em>**Enemy AI:**</em> Enemies in each realm could have different behaviours and abilities based on the realm's element. For example, fire realm enemies could leave a trail of fire behind them, while air realm enemies could fly and attack from above.

<em>**Boss Battles:**</em> Each realm could end with a boss battle that tests all the skills Flix has learned in that realm. The boss could be a minion of the sorcerer who has been by the Orb's power.

<em>**Collectibles:**</em> Flix could collect elemental shards in each level, which could be used to upgrade his abilities. This would encourage exploration and replay ability.
Environmental Interactions: The game could feature interactive environments. For example, in the water realm, currents could push Flix around, while in the earth realm, certain areas of the ground could be destructible.

<em>**Character Progression:**</em> Flix's abilities could be upgraded over time, either through a leveling system or by finding power-ups in the game world. This would give players a sense of progression and reward them for exploring.
Narrative Cutscenes: To enhance the storytelling, there could be cutscenes between levels that show Flix's growth and reveal more about the and the history of the realms.
